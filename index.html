        <h1>Deck of Cards API User Guide</h1>
        <p class="lead">An introduction to a handy tool for building your own card game web apps.</p>
      </div>
	  
	  <div class="well">
        <h1>Introduction to the Deck of Cards API</h1>
        <p>This guide will walk though basic usage of the <a href="http://http://deckofcardsapi.com/">Deck of Cards API</a>. This API provdies useful functionality for 
		developers building their own web-based games which use standard playing cards.</p>
		<h3>What does the Deck of Cards API do?</h3>
		<p>The Deck of Cards API provides several functions which simulate common actions associated with card games. These include generating and shuffling a standard deck of cards or drawing a card from a deck.
		The API also introduces the concept of piles which act as containers for cards and serve to simulate things like a player's hand of cards or a discard pile. This eliminates the need for a developer to
		implement their own functions to accomplish these actions and instead focus on the functions unique to their game.</p>
		<h3>What do I need to know to get started?</h3>
		<p>As the primary use of the Deck of Cards API is to enable integration of card and deck handling functionality into a developer's own web-based card game, it is assumed that the reader has an understanding of
		the basics of HTML and Javascript. The provided code examples will make use of AJAX to show the results of calls to the API without reloading this page.</p>
		<p>Unlike many other API services, the Deck of Cards API does not require developers to register an account or obtain a developer key for their app. This helps to make API calls shorter and easier to assemble.</p>
		<h3>Important Note</h3>
		<p>The code examples presented below build off of one another and are actually implemented in this page, so please 
		be sure to click all the buttons along the way!</p>
      </div>
	  
	  <div class="well" id="decks">
        <h1>Generating and Shuffling Decks</h1>
        <p>As with any card game, one must start with getting a deck to play with. The API has a few methods available for generating a deck. The easiest and most straightforward of these methods is to get a 
		brand new deck that has never been shuffled. That is, you would draw cards from such a deck in the order ace of spades, 2 of spades, 3 of spades, ... king of spades. This order would repeat through the 
		diamonds, clubs, and hearts suits. The following Javascript code will call the new deck function:</p>
		<pre>var baseAPIURL = "https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/";
		
// Assume we have a button with id = "newDeckGet" in our HTML
document.getElementById('newDeckGet').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var newDeckURL = baseAPIURL + "new/";		// https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/new/
    req.open('GET', newDeckURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            var newDeck = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('newDeckResponse').textContent = "Response: " + JSON.stringify(newDeck, null, 2);
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
		</pre>
		<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="newDeckGet">Get a brand new deck</button>
		<pre class = "callResponseText" id="newDeckResponse"></pre>
        
		<p>As you can see, the API returns a JSON object containing parameters describing the generated deck. 
		The most important of these is the "deck_id" key, which is an ID string the Deck of Cards server uses to 
		identify a particular deck. This ID key will be needed later for the card drawing functions. The response 
		also includes useful information about the deck such as whether or not it has been shuffled and how many 
		cards remain in the deck.</p>
		<p>While this gives us some basic insight into what a deck object looks like in Javascript, unfortunately
		one is rarely ever allowed to play a card game with a brand new, unshuffled deck. Luckily the API provides
		a function to shuffle a deck it has generated. Consider the following example:</p>
		<pre>document.getElementById('shuffleDeck').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var shuffleURL = baseAPIURL + "deck/" + newDeck.deck_id + "/shuffle/";
    req.open('GET', shuffleURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            newDeck = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('deckShuffleResponse').textContent = "Response: " + JSON.stringify(newDeck, null, 2);
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
		</pre>
		<button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="shuffleDeck">Shuffle deck</button>
		<pre class = "callResponseText" id="deckShuffleResponse"></pre>
		
		<p>If all went according to plan, the response to this call should look almost identical to the new 
	  deck call except that the "shuffled" key is now set to true. Generating a shuffled deck in this manner is 
	  all well and good; however, the Deck of Cards API offers a method to condense the deck generation and 
	  shuffling into a single API call. This call also allows one to generate a deck that is composed of more 
	  than one standard 52 card deck, e.g. a deck to represent a 6-deck blackjack dealing shoe. To invoke this new 
	  functionality, the query string <code>deck_count=n</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of standard decks 
	  to combine and has a default value of 1. The following code sample demonstrates this call:</p>
	  
	  <pre>var newShuffledDeck;
  
document.getElementById('newShuffledDeck').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var nDecks = 1;
    var shuffleURL = baseAPIURL + "deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=" + nDecks;
    req.open('GET', shuffleURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            newShuffledDeck = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('newShuffledDeckResponse').textContent = "Response: "  + JSON.stringify(newShuffledDeck, null, 2);
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
	  </pre>
	  <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="newShuffledDeck">Get a shuffled deck</button>
	  <pre class = "callResponseText" id="newShuffledDeckResponse"></pre>
	  
	  <p>As you can see, this response is almost identical to the previous result aside from the unique deck_id 
	  associated with this new deck. If you like, you could call the deck shuffle function again with this new 
	  deck_id.</p>
      </div>
	  
	  <div class="well" id="drawing">
        <h1>Drawing Cards</h1>
        <p>Now that we are able to create shuffled decks, let's now look at drawing cards from a deck. The Deck of 
		Cards API actually allows you to draw more than one card at a time using the query string 
		<code>count=n</code> where <code>n</code> is the number of cards drawn. The returned JSON object will 
		contain an array of cards as shown below:</p>
		<pre>var drawnCards;
  
document.getElementById('drawCards').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var nCards = 3;
    var drawURL = baseAPIURL + "deck/"+ newShuffledDeck.deck_id + "/draw/?count=" + nCards;
    req.open('GET', drawURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            drawnCards = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('drawnCards').textContent = "Response: " + JSON.stringify(newShuffledDeck, null, 2);
            for (var i = 0; i < nCards; i++) {
                var cardImg = document.createElement("img");
                cardImg.setAttribute("src", drawnCards.cards[i].image);
                cardImg.setAttribute("height", "150");
                document.getElementById("drawnCardImgs").appendChild(cardImg);
            }
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
		</pre>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="drawCards">Draw 3 cards</button>
	    <pre class = "callResponseText" id="drawnCards"></pre>
		<div id="drawnCardImgs"></div>
		
		<p>There's a lot going on with this response string since we're getting information about both the 
		drawn cards and the deck we're drawing from, so let's look at it piece by piece. The act of 
		drawing 3 cards from our deck reduces the size of the deck by 3, so the "remaining" field gets 
		updated to reflect this alteration to the deck. We then have an array of card objects which contain 
		useful information about the cards such as their suit, rank, and links to PNG image files we can 
		insert in our HTML to display the associated images (which I've done with the help of a few DOM
		functions). Take note of the "code" field belonging to the card objects as these can used in query 
		strings when we look at discarding cards to piles later.</p>
      </div>
	  
	  <div class="well" id="piles">
        <h1>All About Piles</h1>
        <p>A pile is a data contruct used by Deck of Cards to represent any collection of cards that is not 
		a deck. This can mean something like, as the name suggests, a discard pile, but it can also be used to 
		represent a player's hand of cards. The developer can create unique names for any needed piles, and 
		these pile names are included in the request URLs associated with adding to and drawing from piles.</p>
		<p>Adding cards to a pile is as simple as passing card codes in the query string as discussed previously. 
		The following code gives an example of building a pile from the cards drawn in the previous section:</p>
        
		<pre>document.getElementById('addPile').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var nCards = 3;
    var pileAddURL = baseAPIURL + "deck/"+ newShuffledDeck.deck_id + "/pile/hand1/add/?cards=";
    for (var i = 0; i < nCards; i++){
        pileAddURL += drawnCards.cards[i].code;
        if (i < nCards - 1)
            pileAddURL += ",";
    }
    req.open('GET', pileAddURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            var hand1Pile = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('addedToPile').textContent = "Response: " + JSON.stringify(hand1Pile, null, 2);
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
		</pre>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="addPile">Add to the pile</button>
	    <pre class = "callResponseText" id="addedToPile"></pre>
		
		<p>The information returned in this call mainly pertains to the status of the deck and its associated piles 
		after this add operation has completed. As expected, we end up with 3 cards in our pile and 49 cards left 
		in the deck.</p>
		<p>Since we're pretending this particular pile represents a player's hand, it's likely that at some point 
		the player will need to play a card in their hand. In Deck of Cards parlance, this is equivalent to drawing 
		a card from a pile. Note that piles are treated as stack data structures, i.e. the last card added to the 
		pile will be the first one drawn by default. The pile draw function will operate with this behavior by 
		default, but it is possible to specify a particular card to draw using the card code in the query string. 
		A code example of drawing from a pile is shown below:</p>
		
		<pre>document.getElementById('drawPile').addEventListener('click', function(event){
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    var drawURL = baseAPIURL + "deck/"+ newShuffledDeck.deck_id + "/pile/hand1/draw/?cards=";
    // draw from the bottom of the hand1 pile stack, i.e. drawnCards.cards[0]
    drawURL += drawnCards.cards[0].code;
    req.open('GET', drawURL, true);
    req.addEventListener('load',function(){
        if(req.status >= 200 && req.status < 400){
            var drawnPileCards = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            document.getElementById('drawnFromPile').textContent = "Response: " + JSON.stringify(drawnPileCards, null, 2);
        } else {
            console.log("Error in network request: " + req.statusText);
    }});
    req.send(null);
    event.preventDefault();
});
		</pre>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" id="drawPile">Draw from the pile</button>
	    <pre class = "callResponseText" id="drawnFromPile"></pre>
		<p>The returned JSON object contains information about the pile status, the drawn card(s), and the deck_id. 
		We see that the number of cards remaining in the pile is updated by the draw action. We also can see that 
		the card which was returned was the same as the first card drawn from the deck in the 
		<a href="#drawing">previous example</a>.</p>
      </div>
	  
	  <div class="well" id="conclusion">
		<h1>Closing Remarks</h1>
		<p>Hopefully you've gained enough understanding of the Deck of Cards API that you can now sally forth and 
		start building your own card games. The API calls themselves are fairly straightforward and do not require 
		terribly complicated request URLs or query strings, so that should make life easier for you.</p>
