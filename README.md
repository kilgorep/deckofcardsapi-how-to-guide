# A Brief How-To Guide for Using the Deck of Cards API

This guide was developed as a project for the CS 290 Web Development course at Oregon State University. The goal of the project was to research a particular web API and its documentation, then build a simple website that expands on that documentation.

### Project Mastery Goals
* Basic HTML & CSS usage
* DOM manipulation
* Dynamic content via AJAX (API requests & adding response data to the DOM)

The API chosen for this project is the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/). This API generates unique decks of standard playing cards and provides functions for shuffling, drawing cards, and building hands or other card piles. With an understanding of the API's functionality, a developer could go on to build any sort of web-based card game. Since the API website gives a barebones listing of the various supported API calls, the how-to guide goes into greater detail of how the various AJAX functions needed to make the calls and process and display the response.
